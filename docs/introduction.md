# Introduction

As all parents know, "how does it work?" is a recurring question from our children we all must be prepared to answer to.

If we are lucky, we know the answer and provide it to them. Sometime we don't know the answer, so we'll teach them how to search for it. Other times we don't want to provide them with one (and hope they didn't learn too well how to find it).

However there are times when we know the answer, but it is too complicated and providing it will require a reasoning that is best suited for a classroom. "How does internet work?" was one of these questions I received from my children, in different forms, throughout time.

I know the answer, but I also know that it is not a straightforward one and it requires to explain several concepts. I provided them some answers over time, trying to connect all the dots, but I'm not completely satisfied with the result. That's why I decided to attempt and put them down in writing.

"From Scratch" is my effort to explain to my children, possibly in a structured way, some of the knowledge they will need to navigate the complex technical world they are growing into. The main target of this series of articles are my children, with their specific questions and knowledge level. But any child between 10 and 15 years old should find them useful to start learning about the technology that permeates our lives.

Accordingly, language will be kept simple (also because english is not my primary language) and I will gladly sacrify accuracy in favour of clarity. If you are a technological purist, these articles are not for you.

In my intention, you should ideally be able to use these articles as a starting point to accompany your children into the difficult journey to discover how all the different pieces of technology they use on a daily base works together in a delicate balance of trust and cooperation.
