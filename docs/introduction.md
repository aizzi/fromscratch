# Introduction

As all parents know, "how does it work?" is a recurring question from our children we all must be prepared to answer to.

If we are lucky, we know the answer and provide it to them. Sometime we don't know the answer, so we'll teach them how to search for it. Other times we don't want to provide them with one (and hope they didn't learn too well how to find it).

However there are times when we know the answer, but it is too complicated and providing it will require a reasoning that is best suited for a classroom. "How does internet work?" was one of these questions I received from my children, in different forms, throughout time.

I know the answer, but I also know that it is not a straightforward one and it requires to explain several concepts. I provided them some answers over time, trying to connect all the dots, but I'm not completely satisfied with the result. That's why I decided to attempt and put them down in writing.

"From Scratch" is my effort to explain to my children, possibly in a structured way, some of the knowledge they will need to navigate the complex technical world they are growing into. The main target of this series of articles are my children, with their specific questions and knowledge level. But any child between 10 and 15 years old should find them useful to start learning about the technology that permeates our lives.

Accordingly, language will be kept simple (also because english is not my primary language) and I will gladly sacrify accuracy in favour of clarity. If you are a technological purist, keep in mind that these articles are not for you.

Assuming no previous knowledge at all, it is my intention to create a learning path that can be followed by our children. This means that each article will build on previous ones, so they are intended to be consumed sequencially. Anyhow, if previous knowledge exists, you can skip the related articles and start with the topic you are interested to.

There are several ways you can contribute to this project.

To start, you can correct typos, spelling, grammar and syntax errors. As I said, English is not my primary language so I'm perfectly aware that my prose could be made better. If you want to contribute, just submit a pull request and I will check it. Be sure to include your references, so that I can list you among the contributors.

Another way to contribute is to write full articles. If so, submit your pull request to add them. Again, provide your reference to be listed among contributors.

The third way to contribute is to propose topics and questions. If you want to do this, please open an issue and I will try and write the related answer to your question.
